#### What I learned

- Implemented testing functions using Jest on a command line Hangman game.
- We had a client visitor who gave extremely good constructive feedback on our presentation skills and one of our cohort applications.

#### What was difficult

Learning how to manage a team to success. I am the product owner of the Talent Path Pipeline project, and having everyone expect something from you can be overwhelming at times but it's great experience to learn for my future career. Especially if I want to become a PM.

#### What was effective about both your personal and group's work flow

What was effective about my personal workflow was being organized and prepared to help my team be successful in their tasks. My groups workflow was great, this week I was proud that I was able to give tasks and they were able to accomplish them in a timely manner.
